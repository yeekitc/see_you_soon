# Welcome to see_you_soon!
---
see_you_soon is a fluid event scheduler for groups. It attempts to recreate and (improve the UI of) When2Meet, an existing web tool that attempts to help groups of people find a common time to meet. 

After the host creates an event, each member of the group inputs their availability. see_you_soon then aggregates the user data and presents it as an availability matrix for easy reference.


# Sounds great! How can I start?
